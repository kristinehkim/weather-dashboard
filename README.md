## General Information
The user can choose a particular city to find weather information.  Once a city is typed in the search box, the current weather and a 5 day forecast of the weather for that city will be displayed.  For each day, the temperature, wind speed, and humidity will be displayed, as well.  All cities searched will appear in a search history below.
